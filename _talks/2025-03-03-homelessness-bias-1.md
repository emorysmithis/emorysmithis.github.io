## Abstract
Bias towards people experiencing homelessness
(PEH) is prevalent in online spaces. This project
will leverage natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) to identify,
classify, and measure bias using geolocalized data
collected from X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, meeting minutes, and news media across the United
States. While public opinion often refers to addictions, criminality, and high levels of welfare spending to justify bias against PEH, we will conduct a
comparative study to determine whether racial fractionalization is associated with homelessness bias.
The results of the study aim to provide a new path
to alleviate homelessness by unveiling the intersectional bias that affects PEH and minority racial
groups. During the course of the project, we will
deliver a lexicon, compile an annotated database
for homelessness and homelessness-racism intersectional (HRI) bias, evaluate LLMs as classifiers
of homelessness and HRI bias, develop homelessness and HRI bias metrics, and audit existing LLMs
on HRI. In collaboration with non-profits and the
city council of South Bend, Indiana, USA, our ultimate goal is to contribute to homelessness alleviation by counteracting social stigma, restoring the
dignity and well-being of the persons affected.
