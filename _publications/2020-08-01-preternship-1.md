Abstract – Herein, we present the “Preternship”, an
experiential learning method for introducing industry
projects in the classroom early in the CS curricula. We
conduct surveys of 132 industry members and 39 faculty
members, and compare the results to assess opportunity
for experiential learning. Then, we present the format
and post-program survey results of a Preternship for a
48-student introductory computing course and a 16-
student junior/senior level VLSI course, working in
tandem with 27 industry Mentors, to demonstrate the
potential for implementing this program early in CS
curricula. The survey results show significant potential
for the Preternship as a model for enhancing student
skills in project planning and execution, motivating
students to remain in their program, and showcase their
technical and leadership potential to employers.
