I am a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D student at the University of Notre Dame advised by [Dr. Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/) in the [Automatic Program Comprehension Lab](https://github.com/apcl-research). 

My research centers on studying the human visual attention of software engineers. I am especially interested in the mechanical and cognitive ways people solve problems. 
I conduct human studies and utilize an eye-tracker to study the visual attention of programmers. 

My passion for technology has always been rooted in serving others. In addition to research, I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring. I enjoy working with students and envision a teaching-focused career where I can continue to learn from and teach students. 

Beyond my core research, I remain interested in sustainability, bridging the digital divide, civic innovation, and the intersection of language and technology.
